# Project Vera
Project Vera is a single-player combat focused turn-based RPG. The player will control a character and will be able to choose from skills and consumables to engage in combat with their enemy. Stretch goals will include multiple battles and routes, animations, and a player hub to purchase equipment.

The minimum viable product user story will flow as such

1. The player will see the opening screen with three options: `Start`,  `Instructions`, and `Credits`. Instructions will provide the player with information regarding the various systems and icons. Credits will present recognition and licenses to creators and their respective assets.
2. When the player clicks `Start` they will start the battle.
3. The player will have the first turn as determined by their character's stats vs. the enemy's.
4. The player will be able to take one action from the following choices: two offensive skills, health replenishment consumable, and a guard skill.
5. When the player's turn has ended the enemy will take their turn. If the enemy prepares to make a powerful attack for the first time, the player will be prompted to guard against it.
6. the battle will rotate between the 4 and 5 until either the player or enemy has been defeated.
7. Should the player win they will be prompted with a congratulation screen. Should they lose, they will be presented with a game over screen. In both cases they will have the option to start over again.

This is the overview of how the MVP will play out. The desired product along with stretch goals in a table format is included in a pdf within the repo. A wireframe is also included for both the MVP and stretch goals
